# README
Here is the basic html structure for the bank i've been using. 
If you're interested in creating some alternative "themes" you can pull this and create a separate
css file in a folder like this: /themes/<yourtheme>/template.css 

At this time I am not looking to update the html, though i may work with the community to do this in the future.
